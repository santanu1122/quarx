        <p>CloudCatcher, gives you the power to run full backups of your website/application. Not only does CloudCatcher zip all your files into a neat and tidy download, it also grabs your entire database and conviniently places it inside the zipped backup of your Quarx system. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Please be aware in order to utilize the power of CloudCatcher you need to have at least twice the hard drive space available as your website takes. Ex. If your website is 20mb in size, you need at least 40mb of server space to perform the backup opperation. Add to the total size your estimated database size. Ex. If your database is 10mb, you then need at least 50mb of hard drive space to perform the backup.</p>
