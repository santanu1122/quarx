    <h1>Users - Module</h1>
        <p>The users module is a simple manager for users that may subscribe to your application/website. You have the ability to add, edit, delete and disable/enable users at will. Also for safety reasons by default all users when they request an account are not instantly activated. Their account requests require you to authorize them.</p>

        <p>However, don't fear, because settings can be adjusted in the settings screen. You can enable instant authentication etc.</p>

        <p>Auto-Authorization - Enabling this settings ensures that your users who sign up online have instant access to the features that users are given. However, if you're looking for more security you can disable this setting, which means your users are forced to wait until you authenticate thier account.</p>
