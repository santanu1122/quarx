    <h1>Inbox - Module</h1>
        <p>The inbox module acts very similar to a regular email inbox, it comes with some basic settings for the user to permit messages to be sent to their email address etc. The basic element is that if you know the username of a user and wish to message them, or click their name and wish to message them you can. Also, you can enable the system to send messages to your inbox, although doing so requires the Inbox function to be called on a per action basis.</p>
